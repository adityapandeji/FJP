Problem Statement: Build the concept of multiple inheritance by implementing interface features of JAVA programming.

Objectives: 
1. Get familiar with concept of interface in JAVA.
2. Implement multiple inheritance using interface.
3. Implement the Queue data structure using JAVA programming

Learning Outcomes:
1. Implemented the concept of interface in JAVA.
2. Learnt how to implement interface in a class.
3. Implemented the Queue data structure in JAVA using multiple inheritance through interface feature.

Diagram: Draw the diagram for implementation of interface using different techniques.

Que: 
1) What is the multiple inheritance?
2) Why we do not implement the concept of multiple inheritance using classes in JAVA?
3) What is interface?
4) What are the contents in the interface?
5) How to implement the interface? Explain every method using example.
6) Can I inheriate the interface?
7) What is the difference between class and interface?
8) Explain the concept default method in the interface.
9) Explain the concept of static method in the interface.
10)What is the difference between the abstract class and interface?
