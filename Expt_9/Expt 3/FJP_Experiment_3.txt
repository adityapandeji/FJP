Experirment 3: 

Title: Designing class and methods

Problem Statement: Design class Rectangle with the data fields width, length, area and colour. 
The length, width and area are of double type and colour is of string type. 
The methods are get_length(), get_width(), get_colour() and find_area(). 
Create two objects of Rectangle and compare their area and colour. If the area and colour both are the same 
for the objects then display “Matching Rectangles”, otherwise display “ Non-matching Rectangle”.

Objectives: 
1. Learn the concept of class and instance variables.
2. Design a simple class with data fields and methods.
3. Declare and initialize objects of class and call to methods.

Learning Outcomes:
1. Designed a class Rectangle with four data fields and four methods.
2. Learnt the basic concepts of object oriented programming like declarig class and objects, defining class methods and calling methods with objects.
