Experirment 4: 

Title: Method overloading and Constructor overloading

Problem Statement:Demonstrate the method and constructor overloading in JAVA programming.

Objectives: 
1. Implement method overloading in various ways.
2. Implement contsructor overloading.
3. Learn about advantages of method and constructor overloading.

Learning Outcomes:
1. Implemented method overloading in three different ways by changing, i) Number of input parameters, ii) Data (return) type of parameters 
and iii) Order of input parameters.
2. Implemented constructor overloading by writing defualt and parameterized constructor.
